# Credit Card Management System

This project is build with Node and Typescript. It acts a backend application for the [credit-card-management-frontend](https://github.com/jsidharth/credit-card-management-frontend) service.

3. Run `npm run start` - To start the server on port 8001
4. Run `npm run test` - To run the unit test cases
